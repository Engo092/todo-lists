# Todo-List

This is yet another project from The Odin Project curriculum, being the creation of a todo-list website. It is meant to be a practice project for all of the Javascript fundamentals that i've learned recently, to help in more complicated projects in the future.

At its current state this project is still a Work in Progress, though you can add and remove todos as you wish, you can't edit the todos after creating them neither can you see their description as they are stored but not displayed on the page. Additionally, localStorage doesn't work which means that you won't be able to save anything after reloading the page.

While making this project i first focused mostly on the visual aspect of it, and then moved on to the Javascript portion, first making very simple visual changes as you clicked at buttons and then working on dealing with projects as well as todos. I still need to flesh out the todos themselves (make it so that they can be modified) and implement localStorage but other than that most things are finished and i should complete it in the following few days.
