# Todo-List (Visual Demo)

This is yet another project from The Odin Project curriculum, being the creation of a todo-list website. It is meant to be a practice project for all of the Javascript fundamentals that i've learned recently, to help in more complicated projects in the future.

This is an extreme W.I.P and has no functions at all, being only a visual demonstration of what will be the final product. In other words no Javascript has been done yet, only most of the HTML and CSS. I do think it looks quite decent and that is why i am pushing it as the first commit. You can also make out what will be some of the final features.
